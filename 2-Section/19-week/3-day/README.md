## Middleware

Express is "essentially a series of middleware function calls"

## What is Middleware?
- Express allows us to define a stack of actions that follows the request and response cycle. These stack of actions are the middlewares, function code that could be executed if certain conditions are met between receiving a request and sending back the response

- By Definition: any function that takes in `req`, `res`, and `next` as arguments

## How does Middleware work?

Express operates as a stack of middleware functions. It will execute these functions in order upon receiving a request, and stops executing once a response is sent back.

We can add layers to the middleware stack by creating our own middleware functions.

```js
// since this takes req, res, and next, it's an Express Middleware!

const myMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("I'm a middleware function!");
  next();
};
```

To get Express to use this function, we can pass it directly to a route handler

```js
app.get('/', myMiddleware);

// we can also continue to handle the request within the same handler

app.get('/', myMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  // Handling of the request
});
```

We can also pass it to `app.use()`. Anytime you've passed something to `app.use()`, you were adding a layer to the Express Middleware Stack! These are all examples of using middleware

```js
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.static('/catPhotos'));
app.use(myMiddleware);
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.body);
  next();
});
```

Can take in a path as the first argument or defaults to "/" if not specified.

If it's a built-in middleware (`express.json()`), then you don't have to worry about calling `next()`, it's already being done for you. If you are making your own middleware function, you **_must_** call `next()`

## next()

Calling `next()` will tell express to "return" out of our current function and run the next **_applicable_** function.

```js
const mid1 = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Hey I'm mid1!");
  next();
};

const mid2 = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Hey I'm mid2!!");
  next();
};

app.get('/', mid1, mid2);
```

When making a GET request to `/`

```md
# console will print

Hey I'm mid1!
Hey I'm mid2!!
```

Similarly

```js
const myMid = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Hey look I'm printing!");
  next();
};

app.get('/', myMid, (req, res) => {
  console.log('Wow I printed after myMid!');
  res.send('This is the / response');
});
```

```md
# console will print

Hey look I'm printing!
Wow I printed after myMid!!

# browser will display

This is the / response
```

## Error Handling Middleware

Express handles errors through middleware.

## How to use error handling middleware

Error handling middleware _MUST_ have 4 parameters, `err`, `res`, `req`, and `next`, and `err` _NEEDS_ to be the first parameter. This is the only way for Express to recognize something as error handling middleware.

Just like with any other custom middleware, we pass our error handlers into `app.use()` so it can be ran on every request. Error handler should be defined after all other middleware and route handlers.

```js
app.use(express.json())
app.use(myMiddleware)

app.get(...)

app.get(...)

app.post(...)

app.delete(...)

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.log(err)
  res.status(err.status || 500)
  res.send('Whoops! Some error happened I guess?')
})
```
