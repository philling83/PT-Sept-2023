## Question Asking Rubric (Required 1-3):

1) What you are working on
2) A description of the problem
3) What the error message says in the console (if there is one)
4) A relevant code snippet
5) The debugging process youâ€™ve done so far (THIS IS VERY HELPFUL TO DESCRIBE)

## Database

- collection of interrelated tables with relevant data for a given application
  or service

## Table

- Made up of a specific set of columns which specify the type of data, and rows
  which hold the actual data (each row is called a record)
- Every row is a single instance of data, containing a value for every column

## RDBMS - Relational Database Management System

- Program that allows you to create, update, and administer a relational
  database
- Can contain any number of databases
- Examples: PostgreSQL & Sqlite3


## SQL - Structured Query Language

- Language used to construct tables
- There are many tools that make writing SQL easier for us
  - We will learn one, Sequelize, next week!

## PostgreSQL

- What you will use when hosting your projects in production (More on this later on)

## Sqlite3

- What you will use for everything else, its a developmental database not used for large applications since its just a file
- The database is actually just a file in your project folder
- Can be pushed to github, so pairs can pick up from where you left off

### Quick SQLite Commands Reference
Think of SQLite CLI commands like node commands.

- Download *Sqlite Viewer* VSCode Extension
  - Used to view .db files 
- `sqlite3`
  - run `.open name-of-database.db` to open your database
- `sqlite3 name-of-database.db`
  - to run a specific database w/ sqlite3
  - open sqlite3 software RDBMS
- `.read name-of-file.sql`
  - read the sql file into the sqlite db
- `.schema`
  - Grab the schema (structure of how database looks like)


### Basic Intro SQL syntax 
- **IMPORTANT: note the `;` at the end of each SQL command**
- Think of this syntax as something like javascript or css that we then execute to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE from a table.
- `CREATE TABLE <tableName> (...);`
  - generate the schema / structure layout of the table
- `SELECT <colName, ...> FROM <tableName>;`
  - SQL syntax to get all records from a given table
  - the one you'll see often: `SELECT * FROM <tableName>;`
    - `*` === select all from this table.
- `DROP TABLE <tableName>;`
  - drops and removes the table with that specified name
  - drop the table if we're trying to read from the .sql file again

- `INSERT INTO <tableName> VALUES (col1_val, col2_val, ...);`
  - inserting a record (row) into the table

- `DELETE FROM [table] WHERE [condition];`
  - deleting a record (row) from the table
  - for the condition think of a boolean
