## Function Expression Syntax
There's another way that we can write functions. 
```javascript
// function declaration syntax
function helloDeclarationFunc() {
    return 'hello I am a function declaration';

}

// function expression syntax
let helloExpressionFunc = function() {
    return 'hello I am a function expression';
};

console.log(helloDeclarationFunc())
console.log(helloExpressionFunc())
// Both functions are 'being declared' and accomplish the same tasks, 
// we've just set about defining them differently

//check this out:
console.log(helloExpressionFunc)  //[Function: helloExpressionFunc]
//prints a reference to the UNINVOKED function
```

## Mutability
- [Mutability (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Mutable) is the concept of certain pieces of **data** being able to be **changed** or **updated** in **memory**. 
- Mutable
    - Arrays
    - Objects
- Immutable (7 [primitive datatypes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive))
    - string 
    - number 
    - bigint 
    - boolean 
    - undefined
    - symbol
    - null


### Mutable Example
```javascript
let nums = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(nums);
nums[0] = 100;
console.log(nums);
```

### Immutable Example
```javascript
let name1 = "WIZ";
console.log(name1);
name1[1] = "E"; // This will not work
name1[2] = "S"; // This will not work
console.log(name1); //still "WIZ"
//we're unable to mutate or change individual characters in our string. 

// Instead, we'll have to reassign our
// variable to a new string in order to see the change.
```

### Re-Assignment !== MUTABILITY
- **IMPORTANT**: (Assignment or Re-assignment) !== mutability
- **Re-assignment** is having the variable **REFERENCE** a **different** piece of **data**.
```javascript
let name2 = "WIZ"; 
console.log(name2); //"WIZ"
name2 = "WES" // Must reassign to change
console.log(name2); //"WES"
//IMPORTANT: Assignment !== mutability
//assignment is having the variable REFERENCE a different piece of data.
```

### Array Methods
- Arrays have built in functions ([array methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#instance_methods)) on them that we can access to achieve common behaviors. You're already familiar with one, Remember **.concat**?
    - `myArray.concat(array2)`
- Common Methods to cover:
    - [Push ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push)
    - [Pop ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop)
    - [Shift](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift) 
    - [Unshift](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/unshift)

```javascript
// Let's take a look at push first. Calling the .push method allows us to "push"
// new values on to the end of our array, and return the new length of the array
// Let's look at an example:
let arr = [4, 3, 2];

console.log(arr, "length:", arr.length);
let newLength = arr.push(1, 0); // Push will accept any number of arguments

console.log(arr, "length:", newLength);
// We can see that our arguments have been pushed on to our array, modifying its
// contents and length.

// We can think of pop as the opposite of push. Calling the .pop method on an
// array will remove the last element of the array and return it. 
console.log(arr);
let lastEle = arr.pop();
console.log(lastEle, arr);
// We can see our array from earlier, then we pop off and store the last element
// and finally print both the last element and the mutated array

// Much like .push, the .unshift method adds things to our array. The difference
// being that .unshift places our arguments at the beginning of the array. Like
// .push, this method returns the new length of the array

console.log("Old length: ", arr.length) // remember we popped something off

newLength = arr.unshift(0, 1);
console.log("New length: :", newLength, arr);
// We can see that our array now has a length of 6 and has our new elements in
// the beginning

// Just as .push has .pop, .unshift has .shift. This method will remove the 
// first element of the array and return it
let firstEle = arr.shift();
console.log(firstEle, arr);
```
