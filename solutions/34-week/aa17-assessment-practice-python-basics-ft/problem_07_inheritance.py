# PROBLEM 3 - INHERITANCE: Good, Bad and Flying Dragons! üê≤
#
# Import the Dragon class you created in Problem #2.
#
# Define a class "FlyingDragon" that inherits from the "Dragon" class of Problem #2. This class contains the following:
#
# A constructor that takes in all arguments required for the parent constructor,
# then invokes the parent constructor with those arguments.
#
# An additional constructor parameter "wings" with a default value of "massive".
#
# A single protected instance attribute "wings" initialized to the value of its corresponding parameter.
#
# An instance method "encounter" that takes no arguments and,
# depending on whether inherited attribute "_is_good" is true or not, will return a string of either:
#
#       good: "While traveling you suddenly meet a flying dragon named {name}! It lets you take a selfie and admire its {color} scales."
#
#       evil: "While traveling you suddenly meet a flying dragon named {name}! {name} breathes fire everywhere! BURN!!!"
#
# *NOTE: one of the two returns above requires the use of a method that exists on the parent Dragon class.
# *The test will check if this method was called. If it wasn't, you'll get a failure as
# *AssertionError: Expected 'mock' to have been called.
#
# An instance method "fly" that takes no arguments and returns a string of the following format:
#
#     "{name}'s {wings} wings launch it into the air, creating a powerful blast of wind that knocks you over."
#
#
# In addition to running `pytest test/test_problem_03_inheritance.py` you can also
# test your code manually using the sample data below.
#
