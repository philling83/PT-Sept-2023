# *NOTE: This problem is significantly longer and more complex than anything you
# would see on the actual assessment, but working through it will prepare you
# well for anything the actual assessment might ask you to do!
#
# Imagine a boutique pizza restaurant hired you to create software that handles
# orders. You have more code to write and don't want random pizza functions in
# random files, so like a good python programmer you group your pizza functions
# within a class to keep them organized.
#
# Create a class called "PizzaProcessor" that contains methods that manipulate
# dictionary, string and int data types.
#
# The PizzaProcessor class constructor takes no arguments and should have:
#
#      - A protected attribute named "error" initialized to the following string:
#
#           "Invalid data: please check your data types before proceeding."
#
#      - A protected property named "pizzas_made" initialized to 0, that is externally accessed only through your getter method.
#
# *NOTE: All error handling should return the "error" protected attribute. Don't
# forget to make a getter for "pizzas_made".
#
#
# ----- instance method 1: ------ This method will log the customer name and
# their order.
#
# Define an instance method named "pizza_pick" that takes 3 positional arguments
# and returns a string formatted as follows:
#
#     "{arg1} ordered a {arg2} crust pizza with {arg3} toppings!"
#
# Your constraints are as follows:

#     - arg1 must be a string, arg1 must be sentence cased. (you can expect a string with no spaces)
#     - arg2 must be a string, arg2 must be lowercased.
#     - arg3 must be a positive int, arg3 must not be greater than 10.
#
# Return the error attribute if arguments don't match your constraints.
#
# ----- instance method 2: ------
# This method will make a single pizza and give you employee information for that order.
#
# Define an instance method named "pizza_production" that takes 3 keyword arguments in any position:
#
#     time_started, time_ended, employee_name
#
# This function returns a string of the following format:
#
#     "{employee_name} started making pizza at {time_started} and ended at {time_ended}."
#
# This function will increment your pizzas_made property.
#
# If no arguments are passed to your function, default your parameters to None.
# All arguments for pizza_production must be strings.
# Be sure to handle incorrect data types by returning the error instance attribute.
#
# ----- instance method 3: ------
# This method will make a large amount of pizzas and return an object compatible with a database(JSON).
# For this method, use your knowledge of python's "*args" parameter functionality.
#
# Define an instance method named "pizza_prepper" that collects any number of arguments of data type int,
# and returns a dictionary with the following format:
# NOTE: here we are using angle brackets to indicate where the variables should be.
#
#     {
#         <order_number: type str>: { "crust": <type: str>, "toppings": <type: int> },
#     }
#
# *NOTE: The key of each pizza object represent the order number, and should be an index value.
# *Notice order_number is a str type in the format example above. The reason this is converted is to avoid an error when unpacking later.
# *It's a python thing.
#
# This function will increment your pizzas_made property for every pizza made.
#
# Constraints:
#
#     - if the index is odd the crust is stuffed, otherwise the crust is thin.
#     - the parameter value is the number of toppings.
#     - parameters are positive ints and cannot be greater than 10.
#
# Return the error attribute if arguments don't match your constraints.
#
#
# ----- instance method 4: ------
# This method will print all the pizzas returned from your "pizza_prepper" method.
#
# Define an instance method named "pizza_printer".
# This function collects the return of pizza_prepper as an arbitrary number of key/value pairs.
# For this method, use your knowledge of python's "**kwargs" parameter functionality.
# This function will return a base string formatted as:
#
#         "Printing all the pizzas!"
#
# And for each pizza in the order append the following string to your base string:
#
#         "\nOrder {number} is a {crust} crust with {toppings} toppings\n"
#
# Be sure the returned string includes all key value pairs passed into your function.
#
#
# You're finished! ðŸ˜…
#
#
# In addition to running `pytest test/test_problem_05_functions.py` you can also
# test your code manually using the sample data below.
