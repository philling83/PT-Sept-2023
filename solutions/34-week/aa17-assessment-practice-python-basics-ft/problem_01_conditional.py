# PROBLEM 1 - IF STATEMENTS: Too many donuts... üç© üç© üç©
#
# In this problem, write a function named "enough_donuts" that takes an integer
# parameter and returns the corresponding string value found in this table
#
#  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | Input                                        | Output                   |
# |----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
# | Less than or equal to 1                      | "Not enough donuts"      |
# | Greater than 1 and less than or equal to 4   | "That's enough donuts"   |
# | Greater than 4 and less than or equal to 12  | "That's a lot of donuts" |
# | Greater than 12                              | "I hope you are sharing" |

#
# Your code MUST include at least one of each of the following keywords:
#
# * if
# * elif
# * else
#
# All inputs are guaranteed to be greater than 0.

#
# In addition to running `pytest test/test_problem_01_conditional.py` you can also
# test your code manually using the sample data below.
