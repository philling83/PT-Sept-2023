# In this problem, you'll explore the difference between a dictionary in Python
# and a plain-old JavaScript object. Try declaring a dictionary representing a
# cat using the same notation as you would in JavaScript, with the properties
# for `name`, `breed`, and `age`.

# cat = {name : "fluffy"}

# Did you run into any errors executing your code? Try adding or removing
# quotations around the keys in your dictionary and see what effect that may
# have.

# Write your code here.
cat = {"name" : "fluffy"}
print(cat)
