# Python Sets Practice

In this practice, you will work with Python sets.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Change directory into the repository.
3. Make sure you are running Python 3.9.4.

## Usage

The __problems__ directory contains the code that you need to complete. Open
each file and follow the instructions inside to complete the code.

When you have finished, go to the terminal and run `python <file-name>`. For
example, if you have completed the code in __01-create-set-from-list.py__ and
want to see its output, run `python problems/01-create-set-from-list.py` from
the root directory (or simply `python 01-create-set-from-list.py` from inside
the __problems__ directory).

After running your code, check the output in the terminal to make sure it is
correct.
