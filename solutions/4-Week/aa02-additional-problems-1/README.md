# Additonal Practice for your Second Assessment

Try out these additonal practice problems for more practice for the assessment.

## Setup

1. Download the starter project.

## Instructions

Your goal is to solve each problem in both the __pt-3/problems/__ folder and
the __pt-4/problems/__ folder and pass all the test specs.

There are two folders to work in, __pt-3/__ and __pt-4__.

## pt-3/

First, `cd` into __pt-3/__ folder and then run the following commands:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm test` to run all specs.

For additional tests that may help with debugging you can comment in
`console.log()` statements in each file, then run
`node <problem-relative-file-path>` in your terminal. For example,
`node problems/01-common-values.js`

You can run tests for specific problems with `npm test test/<problem-spec-file>`.
For example, `npm test test/01-common-values-spec.js`

## pt-4/

After finishing all the problems in __pt-4__, `cd` into the __pt-4/__
folder and then run the following commands:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm test` to run all specs.

## Submission

Once all of your specs are passing, prepare your work for submission by:

1. Delete the __/node_modules__ folder.
2. Zip up the entire folder including code and specs.
3. Submit your zipped file.
