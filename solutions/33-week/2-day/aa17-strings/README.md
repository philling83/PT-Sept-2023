# Python Strings Practice

In this practice, you will work with Python strings.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Change directory into the repository.
3. Make sure you are running Python 3.9.4.

## Usage

The __problems__ directory contains the code that you need to complete. Open
each file and follow the instructions inside to complete the code.

When you have finished, go to the terminal and run `python <file-name>`. For
example, if you have completed the code in __01-hello-world.py__ and want to see
its output, run `python problems/01-hello-world.py` from the root
directory (or simply `python 01-hello-world.py` from inside the __problems__
directory).

After running your code, check the output in the terminal to make sure it is
correct.
