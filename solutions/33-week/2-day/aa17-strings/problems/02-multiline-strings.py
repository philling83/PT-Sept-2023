# It's time to write your first multiline of code in Python. Use the `print` to
# send a multiline message with a quote in it to the terminal.

# Here is an example of using print to display message to the user:

print('''In this code include "quotes"
of any kind because they won't get confused with
the end of the string!''')

# Display your own message using print below:

print('''
    Multi Line comment
    check this out.
    its cool
''')
