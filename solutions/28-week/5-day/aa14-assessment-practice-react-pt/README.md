# React Practice Assessment

Welcome to the React practice assessment!

In this assessment, you will use React to construct a frontend for a Fruits App
that displays information about fruits.

You will write your code in various files inside the __src__ directory. Your
objective is to complete the project so that all specs pass. Each specs has an
assigned point value. Further instructions and explanation of scoring appear
below.

* __Total Number of Specs:__ 38 specs
* __Total Possible Points:__ 59 points

You will have **2 hours** to complete the assessment.

## Resources

For this assessment, you are allowed to use the following resources:

* [MDN]
* A whiteboard or paper to work out problems/code, but it must be within camera
  range
* VS Code or a console for coding, testing, and experimentation
* Node
* Official documentation, including:
  * [React documentation]
  * [React Router documentation]

You are **NOT** allowed to refer to any other resources, including--but not
limited to--other websites (e.g., AA Open, StackOverflow), communication apps
(e.g., Slack, Discord), search engines, notes, or any of your previously
written code.

[MDN]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
[React documentation]: https://react.dev/
[React Router documentation]: https://reactrouter.com/en/main

## Setup

1. Clone this starter repo and open it in VS Code.
2. Run `npm install` in the root directory.
3. Run `npm test` to see all the specs you need to pass.
4. Finish reading this __README__.
5. Read __FruitsApp.md__ to get started!

Make sure you are using Node version 18! Run `nvm install 18` to install the
latest Node version 18. Then run `nvm alias default 18` to set it as your
default Node version. Finally, run `nvm use 18` to use Node version 18.

## Scoring

Each step below has a varied number of tests. The tests for each step have point
values assigned to them, which means you can get partial credit for partially
finishing a step and getting _some_ of the tests to pass.

If you have errors or warnings in your console (other than those beyond your
control such as cross-origin cookie errors) or erroneously / badly formatted
code, **up to five points may be deducted from your score.**

You can see your score (without the checks for errors or warnings in your
console and without the checks for badly formatted code) at any time by running
`npm run test-with-points`.

> **Note:** Some tests are worth more than one point. When you run `npm run
> test-with-points`, you will see something like this **(the specific numbers
> may be different for you)**:

  ```json
  {
    "testsPassed": 36,
    "testsTotal": 38,
    "pointsEarned": 52,
    "pointsPossible": 59
  }
  ```

> * The **"pointsPossible"** key is the total number of points achievable.
> * The **"pointsEarned"** key is how many points you have currently earned.

## Submission (ONLY FOR ACTUAL ASSESSMENT)

> The following are the submission instructions for the actual assessment. They
> will not work for submitting the practice assessment but are printed here so
> you can familiarize yourself with them.

When you are ready to submit:

1. Run `npm test` in the root directory to re-run all of the tests.
  
2. Fix any syntax errors that cause the tests to crash. **If a test crashes or
   the tests fail to complete their run, you will receive a 0 for the coding
   portion of this assessment.** You can fail specs, but all the tests have to
   be able to finish running.

   **Tip:** If you run out of time to debug, just comment out any code that is
   causing your program to crash.

3. Add, commit, and push your changed files:

   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Finish the assessment (or some such descriptive message)"
   git push
   ```

   **Note:** The first time you run `git push`, git will tell you to run a more
   complete version of the command:

   ```sh
   git push --set-upstream origin <your branch>
   ```

You can run tests, `add` files, and `commit` files as often as you wish, but
only your first **two pushes** will be graded. (If for some reason you need more
than two pushes, you must plead your case to an Instructor.)
