# Weeks 5 + 6 Study Guide

## Concepts
- [Understand how to debug problems](../1-Section/5-week/2-day/README.md)
  - Utilize the debugger or console.log()
- [Be able to solve problems with recursion](../1-Section/5-week/2-day/README.md)
  - Understand terminologies like:
    -  base case, recursive case, recursive step
    -  Using recursion to help solve the original problem by...
       -  solving many smaller sub-problems first
- [String Interpolation](../1-Section/5-week/2-day/README.md)
- [Immediately Invoked Function Expression](../1-Section/5-week/5-day/README.md) (IIFEs)
- [Primitive vs. Reference types](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/js-py---pt-sep-2023-online/week-5---recursion-and-iifes/primitive-data-types-in-depth)
  - Objects are reference types and they are mutable
  - Objects are the only type with methods
- [Hoisting of functions, variables, etc.](../1-Section/5-week/5-day/README.md)
  - function declaration vs function expression 
- [Async vs. Sync Code](../1-Section/6-week/1-day/README.md)
  - Execution of order
  - Examples of async code (setTimeout/setInterval)
- [Event Loop](../1-Section/6-week/1-day/README.md)
  - Call Stack (LIFO)
  - Message Queue (FIFO)
- Previous concepts from earlier weeks like [closure, scope, first class functions, etc.](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/js-py---pt-sep-2023-online/week-4---callbacks--scope-and-closure/closures)
